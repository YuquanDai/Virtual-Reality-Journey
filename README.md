Step 3: Get everything ready (First Time Setup)
There’s a couple of initial setup steps you’ll need to complete first in order to use SideQuest with your headset.
This is all just a one-time setup action – you won’t need to do this every time you want to sideload something, only the first time.
You can follow the setting steps on the download page in Step 2, or you can choose to follow the rest setting parts in this step.

Register as a developer on the Oculus account associated with your Quest. 
In order to use your Quest in Developer Mode (which is required for sideloading), you’ll need to register as a developer organization first.
Enter a new organization name and tick the ‘I understand’ box to agree to the Oculus Terms of Service. You can name your organization whatever you want.

Enable Developer Mode on your Quest.
Now that you’re registered as a developer, you’ll be able to enable Developer Mode on your Quest. You can do this through the Oculus app, with the phone that is linked to your Oculus account/your Quest.
Open the Oculus app on your phone, with your Quest turned on so it can connect to the app, and then:
1. Tap ‘Settings’ in the bottom right
2. Locate your Quest headset listed in the Settings tab, and make sure it reads ‘Connected. (If the app can’t connect to your Quest, you may need to top on the Quest in settings to try and manually make the app connect. If it still can’t connect, make sure your Quest is turned on, and your phone has Bluetooth and WiFi turned on as well)
3. Tap on the arrow button next to your device, to reveal more options
4. Tap the ‘More Settings’ button
5. Tap on ‘Developer Mode’
6. Flick the switch to On instead of Off
7. Fully reboot your Quest – hold down the power button on the side and select ‘Power Off’ or ‘Restart’. Your Quest should fully reboot in order to properly start in Developer Mode.
After rebooting, your Quest should be in Developer Mode.

Step 4: Sideloading an .apk from an external source
To sideload Quest APK files, all you need to do is click on the ‘install APK file from folder’ button.
This will allow you to locate and select the APK file, and SideQuest will then install it onto your Quest. You can check if the installation is successful in the ‘Tasks’ tab.

Step 5: Enjoy your virtual reality journey
After the successful install, put on your VR headset. You can find the file under the category of unknown sources. Choose the file you uploaded and start your amazing virtual reality journey!
